# A5: Data-hiding and Polymorphism
This repo is a compilation of files needed to compile and run Fleet.java

Fleet.java is the only code that needs to be manually compiled and ran. It will automatically access the rest of the files.

Fleet.java will read a textfile, classify the data within it, and create a searchable database that keeps its data private through data hiding and getter/setter methods.
